# 105torus
Project 105torus for B1 - Mathematics at Epitech

Project done in duo with Nathan Lecorchet @HeyShafty

Goal of the project:

The objective of this project is to solve a 4th degree equation:
a
4
x
4
+
a
3
x
3
+
a
2
x
2
+
a
1
x
1
+
a
0
= 0
. A direct
resolution method does exist (Ferrari’s method), but does not generalize. Thus, we will rather compare 3
iterative algorithms:

•
The bisection method,

•
Newton’s method,

•
The secant method.
